No insight into the outcomes of their campaigns "What is the impact on your business by not understanding how your campaigns are performing?

How does that impact your goals like what are the goals for the company?

- If they don't know which campaigns are working then they're just wasting money
- Investing in things that aren't generating the appropriate ROI
- Not optimizing their campaigns correctly" "Marketing Common Data Model (MCDM)
- Identify how much money is spent per channel
- Goal is to optimize for lowest cost per conversion (CPA) and reduce $ spent on highest CPA
- If success is found with the lowest cost per conversion on Google Campaign Manager, we want to allocate more money towards it. To do this, we can pause the campaign and reallocate spend from a lesser channel with a high CPA ,StackAdapt for example.

You want the lowest cost per conversion possible.

See what's performing well and pull back on what's not.

Many hours spent manually pulling reporting "What level of data is being pulled?

How often are you putting this report together?

How much time are you spending?

How many people are doing this?

- This helps us start to put together the business case & translate the hours into a cost
- Ask hard cost question "
</response>

<response>
Slow dashboards or excel docs that crash or don't load "How are they getting the data into that dashboard?

- They might be using a competitor where data connects directly to the dashboard
- Some of the competitors go directly to the dashboard causing very slow loading and frustration
- Emphasize on improvAdo ETL (extract, transform, and load)

When's your contract up with them?

- If their contract is up in the summer they're probably going to need something in place by October
</response>

Unable to explain to their boss what is working and why "How're they doing it today?

What happens when they can't explain these things to their boss?

What are the particular goals that they're trying to meet as an organization?

What happens when not being able to explain?

How are they making optimizations?

- If they're unable to explain to their boss and not able to make data driven optimizations/decisions, they're wasting money

An Executive with no visibility into what their team is doing and how it's working "If you're talking to an executive that does not have visibility into their campaigns, they're probably going to want to hear:

- We can help refocus your team more on insights and less on the process of actually pulling all these reports together at any moment for on-demand visibility & insight into all the campaigns that they're running without having any type of work in order to get to the answers
- Having this at their fingertips, allows their team to make accurate data-driven decisions much quicker to decrease time to make an impact per campaign
- If they're only pulling data manually, they may have gaps in their reporting i.e. pulling data once a week or twice a month
</response>

Time spent on tedious annoying tasks "Chances are data is pulled manually and/or using an in-house build:

What specifically is annoying? (API builds, etc)

What would you rather have you/your team be working on?

Other things to keep in mind:

- Engineering teams are commonly data engineers for the entire company and not specifically dedicated to marketing data
- Because engineers focus on the whole company, they may not be skilled in working with marketing data and/or may not be something that they want to be involved in
- Engineers are often more excited to be building products for their organization rather than building marketing apis and making sure they're not breaking"
</response>

<response>
Unable to get a technical resource to help them with a problem they can't solve "Technical Resources are typically for the whole company and often times not just specifically for marketing:

How long does it take them to get back to you?

Are you able to determine the true impact on your campaigns?

- Keep in mind SLA to pull data varies and can take upwards of 3 months for manual data pulling
- This equates to 3 months of them losing out on opportunity from optimizations"
</response>

<response>
Maintaining APIs is expensive and never ending work. "Maintaining APIs is extensive, never-ending work because APIs are constantly changing allowing room for error if engineers miss something or do not update properly

- Resulting in lost or incomplete data

Engineering resources are one of the most expensive resources of a company:

How many engineers are working on this today?

- From there you know what percentage of their time & cost
- 2 full-time engineers = $300K salary
- $150k on average for an engineer located in the US
- India or another country it might be a lot less so that's another thing to keep in mind

How quickly do they turn things around for you?

Are you able to determine what's in your pipeline today?

- Some teams may have 3 Integrations but have a list of 10 more needed
- They're not going to be getting a full solution for a very long time

No insight into the outcomes of their campaigns Can you let me know a little bit more about this? What do you think is the roadblock or speedbump that's making it difficult to get these insights? In an ideal world, what sort of metrics would you like to be able to see, and how frequently do you need them? (daily, weekly, real time, etc.)

Many hours spent manually pulling reporting improvAdo automates the process of consolidating the data for you, alleviating manual steps and giving your team the ability to easily pull reports as needed. This is a good opportunity to ask how many hours, on average, they think this takes away from their team this week. The faster we can get that info, the faster we can start building a business case. Also, what would they do with that extra time back? Get them thinking about how automating these processes makes their work life better Analyst

Slow dashboards or excel docs that crash or don't load This is a good opportunity to ask what their ideal state would be - when talking with other customers, they start to run into issues with the amount of data that their current setup is trying to process. This is where a solution like improvAdo can allow them to bring in as much data as they need at whatever level of granularity they'd like to use for reporting, and by transforming the data into an actionable state, they can get the granularity they want to see without sacrificing speed to insight.

Unable to explain to their boss what is working and why This is something we hear often; not only getting the data in a timely manner, but being able to trust the data. With a solution like improvAdo, once reports are set up you'll be able to easily jump into the BI Tool of your choice to find the answers you need. And you'll also be able to tap our AI Agent for ad hoc questions (i.e. what was our conversion rate on Facebook the past 2 weeks?) that you can ask in plain language and get answers in seconds, as opposed to having to track down everything manually.

An Executive with no visibility into what their team is doing and how it's working Why is that? What sort of metrics or KPIs would you like more visibility into? We hear this a lot from all types of customers, especially those with multiple business units. When working with folks in a similar situation, the advantage of improvAdo is by bringing all of that data into one place in a digestible format, you'll not only be able to have dashboard views built out for you to give you insight into what's happening, but your teams will also be able to answer ad hoc questions much faster, as opposed to having to track down answers.

Time spent on tedious annoying tasks **This would have a different answer depending on the tasks - most common we hear is that any time there is an ad hoc request, it's annoying to have to track down the data and pull answers from individual channels; in this case, our AI Agent can be used to ask questions of their data in plain language, getting answers in seconds that used to take hours.

Unable to get a technical resource to help them with a problem they can't solve We have purpose-built improvAdo with the marketer in mind - that means that it's a user-friendly interface, and little to no technical knowledge is needed to bring in new data sources, modify the connections, or build out reports. We also provide templates in PowerBI, Tableau, and Looker that can get you started with some quick visualizations, without the need of a tech team.

Maintaining APIs is expensive and never ending work. Exactly, that is why a product like improvAdo exists! It takes that manual work off of your team's plate, allowing us to take on the responsibility of managing and building APIs, so that your team doesn't have to. This frees up the tech team to focus on other initiatives, and gives the marketing team a way to easily add new data sources without tapping other internal teams.

Best one liners for data, analytics, insights? improvAdo automates the marketing data ingestion and transformation process, giving IT and analytics teams time back that they would normally spend on manually building out API connections, doing custom transformations, and creating specific calculations to build dashboards. Our pre-built dashboard templates give BI and analytics teams a head start in getting the data they need for reporting, with the ability to tweak as they need to fit their marketing team's reporting needs.

Best one liners for marketing? improvAdo is purpose built for marketers, meaning the interface is user-friendly (no-code), the channels we extract data from are marketing specific, and the data modeling has been designed with the marketing team's key reporting objectives in mind.

Best way to reference Walmart Connect? We've established a partnership with Walmart Connect that allows their advertisers that use improvAdo to easily incorporate WMC data through a direct API integration; this streamlines the process of analyzing WMC ata alongside all of your other eCommerce and marketing data

Best way to reference Snowflake? Only if they use it for their Data Warehouse - if they do, you can say something like "Great! We want our customers to own their data, and with that in mind we have a partnership with Snowflake that allows us to easily push both raw and transformed data into your Snowflake instance."

Mention or not to mention ETL & Ai? ETL - only mention it if you're ready to explain what it is; I usually reserve it for those I feel are more tech savvy or work in the analytics/biz intelligence departments. For AI, I usually try to feel it out; often times people will ask if and how we use AI, but if it's a more sensitive industry like healthcare or finance, I might steer clear unless they ask.
